  <h1>Let's Learn Something</h1>
  <p>
    Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated Earth’s land ecosystems
    for more than 160 million years. Their evolution, adaptation, and eventual extinction
    provide important insights into biological change and Earth’s geological history.

<!-- HISTORY SECTION -->
<div class="section-title">
  <h2>Historical Overview</h2>
  <p>An introduction to the origins, development, and disappearance of dinosaurs.</p>
</div>

<section class="content-grid">

  <div class="card">
    <h3>1. Origins of Dinosaurs</h3>
    <p>
      Dinosaurs first appeared during the Late Triassic Period, approximately
      230 million years ago. They evolved from archosaurs, a group of reptiles
      that also gave rise to crocodilians and pterosaurs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>2. The Mesozoic Era</h3>
    <p>
      The age of dinosaurs, known as the Mesozoic Era, is divided into three periods:
      Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. Each period saw major evolutionary and
      environmental changes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>3. Evolutionary Advantages</h3>
    <p>
      Dinosaurs possessed upright limb posture, efficient respiration, and
      lightweight skeletons. These features allowed them to move efficiently
      and dominate many ecosystems.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>4. Diet and Ecosystems</h3>
    <p>
      Dinosaurs occupied many ecological roles. Herbivores fed on ancient plants
      such as ferns and conifers, while carnivores acted as predators controlling
      population balance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>5. Growth and Size</h3>
    <p>
      Dinosaurs ranged greatly in size. Some were no larger than modern birds,
      while sauropods grew to lengths exceeding 30 meters and masses over
      60 metric tons.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>6. Behavior and Social Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Fossil evidence suggests some dinosaurs lived in herds, cared for their young,
      and migrated seasonally. Trackways and nesting sites support these conclusions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>7. Fossil Evidence</h3>
    <p>
      Fossils form when remains are buried quickly and protected from decay.
      Over time, minerals replace organic material, preserving bones, footprints,
      and sometimes skin impressions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>8. Mass Extinction</h3>
    <p>
      Around 66 million years ago, a large asteroid impact caused global climate
      disruption. This event, combined with volcanic activity, led to the extinction
      of most dinosaur species.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>9. Survival Through Birds</h3>
    <p>
      Modern birds are direct descendants of small, feathered theropod dinosaurs.
      This connection is supported by skeletal similarities and fossil discoveries.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>10. Scientific Significance</h3>
    <p>
      The study of dinosaurs helps scientists understand evolution, climate change,
      and mass extinction events, offering lessons relevant to modern ecosystems.
    </p>

<!-- DID YOU KNOW SECTION -->
<div class="section-title">
  <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
  <p>Notable records and surprising facts discovered through dinosaur research.</p>
</div>

<section class="content-grid">

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Longest Dinosaur Name</h3>
    <p>
      Micropachycephalosaurus hongtuyanensis has one of the longest scientific names
      among dinosaurs, despite being relatively small in size.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Heaviest Dinosaur</h3>
    <p>
      Argentinosaurus is considered one of the heaviest land animals ever to exist,
      with estimates exceeding 70 metric tons.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Tallest Dinosaur</h3>
    <p>
      Sauroposeidon may have reached heights of over 18 meters, allowing it to feed
      on vegetation far above the reach of other herbivores.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Fastest Dinosaurs</h3>
    <p>
      Ornithomimids, such as Ornithomimus, are believed to have been among the fastest
      dinosaurs, possibly matching the speed of modern ostriches.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Feathers Before Flight</h3>
    <p>
      Fossils show that feathers evolved for insulation and display long before
      they were used for powered flight.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Dinosaur Sounds</h3>
    <p>
      Rather than roaring, many dinosaurs likely produced low-frequency calls,
      hisses, or bird-like vocalizations similar to modern reptiles and birds.
